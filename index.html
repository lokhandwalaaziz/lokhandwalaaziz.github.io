  <h1>Proof of DeBroglie's Wavelength</h1>
<p><strong><em>May 11th, 2019</em> by Aziz Lokhandwala</strong></p>
<h2>Assumptions: Let us consider a material particle such as electron as a standing wave system,
$${f(x) = f(x0) * sin 2πft}$$
It's value at any instant 't' is given as above. Now assume that particle is given velocity 'v' along 
X- Axis. In order to represent variation in f(x) under this new condition we have to make use of transformation equations from special theory of relativity which are independent from frame of reference.</h2>

<p>$$t = {{t' - {v * x \over c^2}} \over {\sqrt {1 - {v^2 \over c^2}}}}$$  
Therefore,
$${f(x) = f(x0) * sin 2π*f*{{t' - {v * x \over c^2}} \over {\sqrt {1 - {v^2 \over c^2}}}}}$$</p>
<p>Now, comparing above equation with 
$$y= {A * sin 2π*f'*({t - {x\over u}})}$$
In this 'u' is the velocity of wave along X-direction
Therefore, 
$$ u = {c^2 \over v}$$
$$ f' = {f \over{\sqrt {1 - {v^2 \over c^2}}}}$$
Now from Einstein's mass energy equations we have,
$$hf = m*c^2$$
$$f' = {{m*c^2}\over h*{\sqrt {1 - {v^2 \over c^2}}}}$$
Now, since 
$$m'= {{m} \over {\sqrt {1 - {v^2 \over c^2}}}}$$
Therefore,
$$f' = {{m'*c^2} \over h}$$
Now λ for matter wave is \(u \over f'\)
Therefore,
$$λ = {{c^2 \over v}\over {m'*c^2 \over h}}$$
Therefore,
$$λ = {h\over{m'*v}}$$
Therefore,
    <em>$$λ = {h\over p}$$</em>
<strong>Hence Proved</strong></p>
